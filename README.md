# angular2-components
Bootstrap tabs with adding and closing tabs

Hi, I am pretty new to Angular2, now I am developing a reporting app with Angular2 and PHP.

Here you will find some components I am working on to implement navigation into my app, much of the code comes from tutorials I have read on the web and whatched on youtube, I just took some parts, mixed up and added some spice :) (just like any developer would do).

I hope it is usefull to anyone who would like to use it, and I am also willing to get any feedback you could give me!
